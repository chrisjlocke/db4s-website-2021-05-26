This repo contains the source for sqlitebrowser.org (the
website). It's uses [CommonMark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
(also known as Markdown) for the content, with
[Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) to provide
the theme and general structure.

To create changes, install Blogdown and point it at a
local copy of this repository.  It should work pretty
automatically. :smile:

Feel free to change things around, and submit PR's as desired.

License not yet decided.  It'll probably be CC0, or maybe
the same as DB4S itself.
