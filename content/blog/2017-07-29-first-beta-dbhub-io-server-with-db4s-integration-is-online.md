The first "[db4s-beta](https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite)" server is now online, which DB4S 3.10.0-beta can store/retrieve databases in.

<center>Feel free to [create an account](https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite) and try things out (the link in the top right of that page). :smile:

Don't store important data in it yet though, as we don't have backups set up yet.</center>
