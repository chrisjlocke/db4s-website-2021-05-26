Thanks to [our wonderful Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/db4s), we've been able to purchase a HiDPI monitor ([Dell P2415Q](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/cty/dell-24-ultra-hd-4k-monitor-p2415q/spd/dell-p2415q-monitor)) for Martin, one of our senior developers.

A special thanks also goes to Nikolay Zlatev of [Astra Paging](http://www.astrapaging.com) too, for organising the purchase and shipping of the monitor around the EU.

This should enable - or at least strongly help - with fixing the remaining HiDPI related bugs that people have reported over the years.

Good stuff! :grinning:
