Thanks to the dedicated efforts of [@mgrojo](https://github.com/mgrojo), our [nightly builds](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest) now include a "Dark style" theme courtesy of the [QDarkStyleSheet project](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet):

To activate it, choose "Dark style" from the "Application Style" dropdown in Preferencesâ†’General:

To turn it off, choose "Follow the desktop style" instead.
