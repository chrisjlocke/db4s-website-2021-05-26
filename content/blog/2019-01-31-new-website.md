Experimenting with a new approach for the DB Browser for SQLite website,
as the old 1-page website was difficult to expand with blog/info on what
we've been working on.

This new layout - using [Hugo][hugo] and [blogdown][bdown] - should be a
decent foundation, and is fairly customisable.

It also has [many available themes](themes), which we'll
likely experiment with too.
