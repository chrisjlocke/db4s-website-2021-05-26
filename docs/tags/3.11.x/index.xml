      <description>The macOS installer for 3.11.1 has been updated, so now when the application runs it does so in &amp;ldquo;light theme mode&amp;rdquo; (the Aqua look) on macOS Mojave. ðŸ˜„
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.11.1v2.dmg
It&amp;rsquo;s a workaround for anyone using Mojave in Dark mode, which Qt doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet properly support. Without this workaround, the colour pallete was unusable in important places. eg white on white when browsing data ðŸ˜¦
Jesse Jackson, thank you so much for showing us how to fix this problem.</description>

      <description>Note that this is effectively 3.11.0 from last week, with a critical bug fix on top + some other additional fixes.
Note 2 - If you&amp;rsquo;re using Dark Mode on macOS Mojave, Do Not download this release. Dark Mode support is broken (badly) on MacOS. It should (hopefully) be fixed in the next point release.
Highlights  DBHub.io improvements CSV import: speed, memory usage, usability, type detection and new default rules Attach databases Menu options for filtering JSON and XML editors Improvements to the plot UI Better copy &amp;amp; paste support Dark theme support on Linux  Dark mode support for windows and macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t working yet.</description>

      <title>Version 3.11.0 pulled - encrypting databases non-functional</title>

      <description>A serious bug has been found in the recent 3.11.0 release&amp;hellip; newly encrypting databases doesn&amp;rsquo;t work (#1732), instead displaying an error message. ðŸ˜¦
Existing databases - encrypted or not - can be opened without problem. The problem only occurs when attempting to newly encrypt a database.
The links on our download page have been reverted back to the prior stable release (3.10.1) for now, while we look into this.
There will probably be a 3.</description>
