      <title>Adding basic visualisation capability to dbhub.io</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun adding the first visualisation pieces to DBHub.io, so people can display charts from their data.
eg:
This is only the starting point (eg a simple vertical bar chart) while we experiment, to find a good workflow that&amp;rsquo;s easy for people to use + customise.
We&amp;rsquo;re aiming to add several more chart types to choose from, and there being a selection of easy-to-use predefined templates as well.
Advanced users will ideally be able to input their own SQL queries for generating the data points to visualise.</description>

      <description>Our sister website, DBHub.io - where people can backup their databases, share them with others, and collaboratively develop data - has a proper landing page from today:
Â https://dbhub.io
It required quite a lot of effort to assemble, even though it&amp;rsquo;s just a simple description, screenshots (click them!), and an overview video. ðŸ˜‰
Please take a look, create an account (it&amp;rsquo;s free), and try things out.
The website code is fully Open Source, and is gaining interesting + useful capabilities over time.</description>

      <title>Standard username/password logins now working for DBHub.io</title>
      <link>/blog/standard-username-password-logins-now-working-for-dbhub-io/</link>

      <description>A small, but important, update about DBHub.io logins. ðŸ˜‰
People can now create accounts using their own username/password again, instead of needing to login via GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn.
It used to work (ages ago), but Auth0 found a security problem with the version of NodeJS they were using, so disabled it for everyone last year. It was fixable by changing some stuff, which has now been done.
On a related note&amp;hellip; login (using username/password) only works if &amp;ldquo;3rd party cookies&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t blocked in your web browser.</description>

      <description>The first &amp;ldquo;db4s-beta&amp;rdquo; server is now online, which DB4S 3.10.0-beta can store/retrieve databases in.
Feel free to [create an account](https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite) and try things out (the link in the top right of that page). ðŸ˜„ Don&amp;rsquo;t store important data in it yet though, as we don&amp;rsquo;t have backups set up yet.</description>
