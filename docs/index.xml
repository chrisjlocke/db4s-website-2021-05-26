      <description>Experimenting with a new approach for the DB Browser for SQLite website, as the old 1-page website was difficult to expand with blog/info on what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
This new layout - using Hugo and blogdown - should be a decent foundation, and is fairly customisable.
It also has many available themes, which we&amp;rsquo;ll likely experiment with too.</description>

      <description>This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini (@piacentini) from Tabuleiro Producoes, as the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.
The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio.</description>
